## Tools

[Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/tools-jsp.html) contains several tools to assist in program development and debugging, and in the monitoring and troubleshooting of production applications. 

[JDK Development Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/) includes the Java Web Start Tools (javaws) Java Troubleshooting, Profiling, Monitoring and Management Tools (jcmd, jconsole, jmc, jvisualvm); and Java Web Services Tools (schemagen, wsgen, wsimport, xjc).

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. Availble on Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS.

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE for Java, but it also understands and provides intelligent coding assistance for a large variety of other languages such as Kotlin, SQL, JPQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc., even if the language expression is injected into a String literal in your Java code.

[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/features/java/index.html) is an IDE provides Java developers with all the tools needed to create professional desktop, mobile and enterprise applications. Creating, Editing, and Refactoring. The IDE provides wizards and templates to let you create Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME applications.

[Java Design Patterns ](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) is a collection of the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud written in Java.

[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is a Java VM implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, caching, primitives, strings, and more! It is widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many other companies as well.

[okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) is a HTTP client for Java and Kotlin developed by Square. 

[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java develped by Square.

[LeakCanary](memory leak detection library for Android. ) is a memory leak detection library for Android develped by Square.
