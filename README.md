## Tools

[Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/tools-jsp.html) contains several tools to assist in program development and debugging, and in the monitoring and troubleshooting of production applications. 

[JDK Development Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/) includes the Java Web Start Tools (javaws) Java Troubleshooting, Profiling, Monitoring and Management Tools (jcmd, jconsole, jmc, jvisualvm); and Java Web Services Tools (schemagen, wsgen, wsimport, xjc).

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. Availble on Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS.

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE for Java, but it also understands and provides intelligent coding assistance for a large variety of other languages such as Kotlin, SQL, JPQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc., even if the language expression is injected into a String literal in your Java code.

[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/features/java/index.html) is an IDE provides Java developers with all the tools needed to create professional desktop, mobile and enterprise applications. Creating, Editing, and Refactoring. The IDE provides wizards and templates to let you create Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME applications.

[Java Design Patterns ](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) is a collection of the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud written in Java.

[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is a Java VM implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, caching, primitives, strings, and more! It is widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many other companies as well.

[okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) is a HTTP client for Java and Kotlin developed by Square. 

[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java develped by Square.

[LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) is a memory leak detection library for Android develped by Square.

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities with elegant and fluent APIs in Java and Scala.

[Fastjson](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/wiki) is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.

[libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) is a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, your WebGL enabled browser and iOS.

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is the leading open-source automation server. Built with Java, it provides over 1700 [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to support automating virtually anything, so that humans can actually spend their time doing things machines cannot.

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a free multi-platform database tool for developers, SQL programmers, database administrators and analysts. Supports any database which has JDBC driver (which basically means - ANY database). EE version also supports non-JDBC datasources (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB, etc).

[Redisson](https://redisson.pro/) is a Redis Java client with features of In-Memory Data Grid. Over 50 Redis based Java objects and services: Set, Multimap, SortedSet, Map, List, Queue, Deque, Semaphore, Lock, AtomicLong, Map Reduce, Publish / Subscribe, Bloom filter, Spring Cache, Tomcat, Scheduler, JCache API, Hibernate, MyBatis, RPC, and local cache.

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. From mobile apps to microservices, from small startups to big enterprises, Gradle helps teams build, automate and deliver better software, faster. Write in Java, C++, Python or your language of choice. 

[Apache Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming. 

[JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) is a free code coverage library for Java, which has been created by the EclEmma team based on the lessons learned from using and integration existing libraries for many years.

[Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) is  used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources, Web dynamic applications. It also used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.
